  "directions" : "1. In a small bowl, mix 1 tsp sugar, yeast and warm water. Allow the yeast slurry to stand for about 10 minutes, or until it turns foamy (as below). If the mixture doesn’t foam, it could be an indication that you’re yeast is no longer active, and your dough won’t rise.\n2. In a sauce pan, scald milk over medium heat– once it bubbles, remove it from the stove, and mix in 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter, and salt until melted. Allow to cool until luke warm.\n3. In a large bowl, combine yeast slurry, milk mixture, eggs, zest and flour. Using your hook attachment on your stationary mixer, mix on low until combined. Once most of the ingredients appear damp and slightly combined, increase speed and allow to mix for 8 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.\n4. Once the dough has pulled together, turn it onto a lightly flour-dusted surface, and knead for an additional 2 minutes. Round into a ball, and place in large, lightly oiled bowl. Cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in volume (about 30 minutes).\n5. Remove your dough from the bowl, and return to lightly floured surface. Evenly divide the dough into 6 parts (each roll will make approximately 4 colacs.  Round divided dough into balls and return to greased bowl for the second rise. Cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for an additional 25-30.\n6. Generously grease the dowels with oil.\n7. Roll out each dough ball into oblong ovals (5 x wider than tall– think “beaver tail”), and cut out 1″ strips. Beginning from one end, wrap the dough around the dowel on a slight angle, pinching the dough and “tucking it in” when you get to the end.\n8. Prepare all of your dowels prior to baking, and fry at 350′F, rotating until golden brown. Remove from oil, and allow to co0l. Once cooled, carefully remove the pastry from the dowel. Brush with a one to one ratio of sugar/water syrup, and roll in sugar or nuts. Serve immediately, or wrap for later.",
